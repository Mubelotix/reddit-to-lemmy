[Click here.](https://i.imgur.com/m8mbW4i.gif)**\n\u003e\n\u003e  * [](#icon-information) [Message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskMen) with any questions/comments.  This includes external sites looking to farm responses for content. NO SURVEYS.\n\n\u003e  * [](#icon-information) **Read the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/wiki/index) wiki and do a search before asking a question.**\n\n\u003e  * [](#icon-information) **We do not allow questions/comments from throwaways or accounts with low karma (\u003c 5 for comments, \u003c 10 for posts).** Participate elsewhere on Reddit to gain experience and karma before trying to post here.\n\n\u003e  * [](#icon-information) **Be respectful.** Anyone is allowed to ask and answer questions. Do not insult or troll people, including in PMs.\n\n\u003e  * [](#icon-information) **Don't comment/post self-deprecating content looking for attention.**  First warning is a temp ban, second warning is a permaban.  If you want to be a sad sack and complain about your life, go to /r/rant or /r/ForeverAlone \n\n\n\u003e ###Post Guidelines:\n\n\u003e 1. [](#icon-cross) **Don't be an asshole / be respectful to others.**\n\n\u003e   Don't be an asshole.  Pretty simple.  This does not mean you can report people for saying mean things to you and hurting your feefees.  We're not a safe space here, if you make a comment or an argument, be prepared to defend it if people call you out on your shit.  But don't resort to name calling or telling people to kill themselves. Blatant racism, sexism etc is punishable with a permanent ban.  Posting AI generated comments will results in a ban.\n\n\u003e 2. [](#icon-information) **The title of your post must contain an actual, concise question. No clickbait titles.**\n\n\u003e   The title of your post must contain an actual question. Keep your question concise, and don't make a clickbait title like \"What do you think of this?\". Any question that can be answered with “Some do, some don’t. Men are not all the same” falls under this rule.\n\n\u003e 3. [](#icon-information) **Read the Frequently Asked Questions wiki and do a search before asking a question.**\n\n\u003e   We remove frequently asked questions. [you can find them here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/wiki/index). Apart from these, we also remove questions that we deem frequently asked enough to warrant removal but have not yet been added to the FAQ.\n\n\u003e 4. [](#icon-cross) **Do not post asking about dating advice, or a person or group's actions, behavior, or thinking.**\n\n\u003e   Do not make posts trying to figure out a specific person's actions, behavior, or thinking.\n\n\u003e   NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HE/SHE IS THINKING. ASK THEM! Don't ask men when you really want to ask A man.\n\n\u003e   *This is not a place to seek dating or relationship advice*. Go to /r/advice or /r/relationship_advice.\n\n\u003e   This also goes for wanting to suss out men or women's behavior as an entire gender. We don't want people speculating into the actions and behaviors of people they arent.\n\n\u003e 5. [](#icon-cross) **YES/NO/\"Does anyone else\" questions will be removed at our discretion.**\n\n\u003e   Taken from the mod post:\n\n\u003e   If we feel like your question can be answered with a \"yes\" or a \"no\", asks \"does anyone else do/feel this way\", or asks \"is X behavior normal\", we will remove it. This also includes 'A or B?' or \"What would you rather?\" type questions\n\n\u003e   This is pretty straightforward. Please exercise some common sense here.\n\n\u003e 6. [](#icon-cross) **Do not make posts looking for affirmation of your appearance, personality or body features.**\n\n\u003e   Do not make posts looking for affirmation of your appearance, body features, personality traits or life situation. Do not make posts asking about what you look like or what you should wear or what makeup men like. Nobody gives a shit. Go make an instagram post.\n\n\u003e 7. [](#icon-cross) **Do not post negative/forever alone rants.**\n\n\u003e   Do not post negative/forever alone rants. Visit /r/ForeverAlone or /r/rant if you want to complain.\n\n\u003e 8. [](#icon-cross) **Don't comment/post self-deprecating content looking to get karma or attention.**\n\n\u003e   Don't comment/post self-deprecating content looking to get karma or attention. Example: if someone asks what your favorite thing about your girlfriend is and you reply with \"lol that she actually existed lol\" or \"she's my hand lol-ercopter\", we're going to issue a temp ban to you for the first offense and a permaban the next time. Keep your replies on-topic for people asking questions.\n\n\u003e 9. [](#icon-cross) **No questions about gifts or presents.**\n\n\u003e   Seriously, no gift threads. If you are going to ask \"what should I get\"/\"what would be a good gift for\" someone, then go to /r/gifts right now and post your question there because we will not take this shit. This also includes asking for other ways to celebrate/thank/show appreciation to someone.\n\n\u003e 10. [](#icon-cross) **No agenda posting, and no brigading/complaining about other subs.**\n\n\u003e   Don't post a question that is obviously geared towards creating an echo chamber where you can either a) create a circlejerk about how everyone agrees with you or b) get into fights with everyone because you're right and everyone else is a shitlord/plebian/whatever. If you want to get into stupid slapfights with people, then take it somewhere else.\n\n\u003e   Do not link to other subreddits with the intention to draw attention to a certain post or comment. Only archived reddit post links will be approved.\n\n\u003e 11. [](#icon-cross) **Medical advice is not allowed here.**\n\n\u003e   Medical advice is not allowed here. We recommend talking to a medical professional instead of the Internet.\n\n\u003e 12. [](#icon-cross) **We do not allow surveys or promotional content.**\n\n\u003e   Message the moderators with any questions/comments. This includes external sites looking to farm responses for content. We don't currently allow surveys or promotional content.\n\n\u003e 13. [](#icon-cross) **Overly political questions will be removed.**\n\n\u003e   Overly political questions will be removed. There are subs like /r/politics, r/PoliticalDebate, and /r/PoliticalDiscussion if you want to debate political ideas or candidates.\n\n\u003e 14. [](#icon-cross) **Questions overly sexual in nature will be removed.**\n\n\u003e   \"How to sex/sexiest sex you’ve ever sexed/when-where-what sex do you like/ why is sex thing sexy?” and questions of that nature will be removed at our discretion.\n\n\u003e   There are many subs dedicated to these types of questions, please take it there as we’re sick of them: r/sex r/AskRedditAfterDark r/sexoverthirty\n\n\u003e Sometimes automod fucks up - if you think it did, you can message us, but if you roll up to the modmail with a fucking attitude, we're not going to indulge you.  The askmen moderation team reserves the discretion to remove posts and ban users that do not contribute positively to the community. Do not try to play Rules Lawyer with the moderation team.","richtext":"{\"document\":[{\"c\":[{\"c\":[{\"e\":\"raw\",\"t\":\"Community Rules:\"}],\"e\":\"h\",\"l\":3}],\"e\":\"blockquote\"},{\"c\":[{\"c\":[{\"e\":\"text\",\"f\":[[1,0,20]],\"t\":\"DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE.\"}],\"e\":\"par\"}],\"e\":\"blockquote\"},{\"c\":[{\"c\":[{\"e\":\"text\",\"f\":[[1,0,56]],\"t\":\"Unsure if the rules apply to you for your post/comment? \"},{\"e\":\"link\",\"f\":[[1,0,11]],\"t\":\"Click here.\",\"u\":\"https://i.imgur.com/m8mbW4i.gif\"}],\"e\":\"par\"},{\"c\":[{\"c\":[{\"c\":[{\"e\":\"link\",\"t\":\"\",\"u\":\"#icon-information\"},{\"e\":\"text\",\"t\":\" \"},{\"e\":\"link\",\"t\":\"Message the moderators\",\"u\":\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskMen\"},{\"e\":\"text\",\"t\":\" with any questions/comments.
